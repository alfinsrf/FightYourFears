Hi, I'm Alfin 👋
<br>
I'd like to explain the game I've created. Enjoy! 
**Fight Your Fears** is a 2D top-down shooting game where we as players have to beat monsters that embody fear.

You must go to the end of the path ahead, and in the vast fields, there will be monsters waiting to be conquered.

Each time you defeat a monster, you will be rewarded with valor points that can be used to heal yourself or upgrade your damage and unlock skills. Valor points will also be used to end the game.
